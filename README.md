# ravenlib
This is the crate for the library portion of [raven](https://git.sr.ht/~nicohman/raven). Docs are [here](https://docs.rs/ravenlib), an explanation of all available options is available in the raven README and you can find example code in raven itself.

## Contributing and Issues

I'm very happy to take pull requests and bug reports, but I'm migrating to [sr.ht](http://sr.ht), and I would prefer it if you would put issues into the [todo.sr.ht tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~nicohman/ravenlib) and send patches/pull requests to the [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~nicohman/raven) for raven and ravenlib. There's a guide for submitting patches [here](https://man.sr.ht/git.sr.ht/send-email.md). Issues and pull requests will still remain open, but sr.ht is preferred.
